# Incident Response Playbook: Malware Infection

## Step 1: Identification and Triage

1. **Alert Notification**:
   - **Receive Alerts**:
     - **Sources**: Monitor alerts from IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), antivirus solutions, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platforms, and user reports.
     - **Integration**: Ensure alerts are integrated and centralized in a single dashboard for efficient monitoring.
   - **Classify Alerts**:
     - **Severity Levels**: Categorize alerts based on predefined severity levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) using criteria such as potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.
     - **Prioritize**: Assign priority based on the potential damage and urgency, focusing on high-priority alerts first.

2. **Initial Triage**:
   - **Assess Impact**:
     - **Affected Assets**: Identify and list affected systems (servers, workstations, critical infrastructure) and data repositories.
     - **Potential Impact**: Evaluate the possible impact on business operations, including data loss, system downtime, and financial implications.
   - **Initial Assessment**:
     - **Scope**: Determine if the malware is isolated to a single device or if it has spread across the network.
     - **Threat Level**: Assess whether the malware is a known threat or an emerging, unknown variant.

3. **Isolation**:
   - **Containment**:
     - **Network Isolation**: Disconnect affected systems from the network to prevent further spread. Use network segmentation or VLANs to isolate the infected segment.
     - **Physical Isolation**: For severe infections, consider physically disconnecting devices from network cables or Wi-Fi.
   - **Preserve Evidence**:
     - **Forensic Preservation**: Avoid turning off or restarting systems to preserve volatile data. If necessary, create forensic images of affected systems.

## Step 2: Analysis and Investigation

4. **Collect Information**:
   - **Data Gathering**:
     - **System Logs**: Collect logs from affected systems, including operating system, application logs, and security logs.
     - **Network Traffic**: Capture network traffic to identify communication patterns and command-and-control servers.
     - **Memory Dumps**: Acquire memory dumps for analysis of malware behavior and artifacts.
     - **File Artifacts**: Retrieve and analyze files related to the malware, including executables and configuration files.
   - **User Activity**:
     - **Access Logs**: Review user access logs and activity trails to identify potential vectors of infection or data exfiltration.

5. **Malware Analysis**:
   - **Behavior Analysis**:
     - **Sandbox Analysis**: Execute the malware in a controlled sandbox environment to observe its behavior and actions.
     - **Static Analysis**: Examine the malwareâ€™s code and structure using reverse engineering techniques to identify IOCs.
   - **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
     - **Identification**: Document IOCs such as file hashes, registry keys, network signatures, and URLs.
     - **Correlation**: Cross-reference IOCs with known threat databases and existing security logs.

6. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - **Initial Attack Vector**:
     - **Exploit Analysis**: Determine how the malware initially infiltrated the organization (e.g., phishing, exploit, insider threat).
     - **Security Gaps**: Review security controls and defenses to identify weaknesses or misconfigurations.
   - **Vulnerability Assessment**:
     - **System Vulnerabilities**: Assess whether known vulnerabilities were exploited and apply necessary patches or configurations.

## Step 3: Containment and Mitigation

7. **Containment**:
   - **Network Segregation**:
     - **Firewall Rules**: Implement firewall rules to block malicious traffic and isolate infected segments.
     - **VLANs**: Create virtual LANs to separate infected systems from clean segments.
   - **Endpoint Isolation**:
     - **Quarantine**: Use endpoint isolation technologies to quarantine compromised devices, preventing further spread.

8. **Mitigation**:
   - **Temporary Countermeasures**:
     - **Update Signatures**: Update antivirus and anti-malware signatures to detect and block known variants of the malware.
     - **Intrusion Prevention**: Apply IPS rules to block malicious traffic and prevent exploitation attempts.
   - **System Hardening**:
     - **Service Disabling**: Disable unnecessary services and features that could be exploited by the malware.
     - **Patching**: Apply critical security patches and updates to address vulnerabilities.

## Step 4: Eradication

9. **Removal**:
   - **Advanced Tools**:
     - **Malware Removal**: Use advanced malware removal tools and EDR solutions to cleanse infected systems.
     - **Deep Scans**: Perform thorough scans of system memory, boot sectors, and registry entries to ensure complete removal.
   - **Validation**:
     - **Verification**: Verify that all traces of malware are removed and that systems are operating normally.

10. **System Hardening**:
    - **Access Controls**:
      - **Least Privilege**: Implement and enforce least privilege access controls to limit potential future breaches.
    - **Vulnerability Management**:
      - **Regular Assessments**: Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and apply patches to address security weaknesses.

## Step 5: Recovery

11. **Data Restoration**:
    - **Backup Validation**:
      - **Integrity Checks**: Ensure that backup files are clean and have not been compromised by performing integrity checks.
      - **Restoration**: Restore data and systems from clean backups, ensuring business continuity.
    - **Operational Resumption**:
      - **Monitoring**: Monitor restored systems closely for any signs of residual malware or re-infection.

12. **System Reintegration**:
    - **Gradual Integration**:
      - **Controlled Reintroduction**: Gradually reintroduce cleaned systems back into the production environment.
      - **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring during reintegration to detect any anomalies.

## Step 6: Post-Incident Analysis

13. **Lessons Learned**:
    - **Post-Mortem Review**:
      - **Incident Review**: Conduct a detailed review of the incident, including what went well and what could be improved.
      - **Identify Gaps**: Document and address gaps in the incident response process and overall security posture.
    - **Improvement Plan**:
      - **Action Items**: Develop and implement an action plan to address identified weaknesses and improve future incident responses.

14. **Documentation**:
    - **Incident Record**:
      - **Detailed Logs**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of all actions taken during the incident, including timelines and decisions made.
      - **Audit Trail**: Ensure that documentation is thorough for audit and compliance purposes.

## Step 7: Communication and Reporting

15. **Internal Communication**:
    - **Stakeholder Updates**:
      - **Regular Updates**: Provide regular updates to internal stakeholders, including IT teams, management, and legal departments, regarding the incident status and response efforts.
      - **Post-Incident Briefing**: Conduct a debriefing session to review the incident response and any changes to procedures.

16. **External Reporting**:
    - **Regulatory Compliance**:
      - **Legal Reporting**: Report the incident to external regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, or affected customers as required by regulations or contractual obligations.
      - **Public Communication**: If applicable, prepare and issue a public statement or notification regarding the incident.
