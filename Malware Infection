# Incident Response Playbook: Malware Infection

## Step 1: Identification and Triage

1. **Alert Notification**: Receive alerts from various detection mechanisms such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), antivirus software, security information and event management (SIEM) platforms, or user reports.
    - Classify alerts based on severity levels (e.g., low, medium, high) and prioritize them accordingly.
2. **Initial Triage**: Immediately assess the potential impact of the alert on critical systems and services.
    - Determine the affected assets, including servers, workstations, and critical data repositories.
3. **Isolation**: Rapidly isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent further spread of the malware and to preserve evidence for forensic analysis.
    - Employ network segmentation or physical isolation techniques to contain the infection.

## Step 2: Analysis and Investigation

4. **Collect Information**: Gather comprehensive data about the malware infection, including:
    - Logs from affected systems, network traffic, and security devices.
    - Memory dumps and file artifacts related to the malware.
    - User activity logs and access trails.
5. **Malware Analysis**: Conduct thorough analysis of the malware to understand its characteristics, behavior, and potential impact on the organization.
    - Use sandbox environments to execute the malware and analyze its activities in a controlled setting.
    - Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), including file hashes, registry keys, and network signatures.
6. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate the initial attack vector and determine how the malware infiltrated the organization's defenses.
    - Review security controls, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and endpoint security solutions, for potential gaps or misconfigurations.

## Step 3: Containment and Mitigation

7. **Containment**: Implement containment measures to prevent the malware from spreading further and causing additional damage.
    - Segregate infected systems from the rest of the network using VLANs or firewall rules.
    - Deploy endpoint isolation technologies to quarantine compromised devices.
8. **Mitigation**: Deploy temporary countermeasures to mitigate the impact of the malware while permanent solutions are being implemented.
    - Update antivirus signatures and deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to block known malware variants.
    - Disable unnecessary services and apply security patches to vulnerable systems.

## Step 4: Eradication

9. **Removal**: Use advanced malware removal tools and techniques to eradicate the malware from infected systems thoroughly.
    - Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for real-time monitoring and remediation.
    - Perform deep scans of system memory, boot sectors, and registry entries to ensure complete removal of the malware.
10. **System Hardening**: Strengthen the security posture of the organization by implementing long-term measures to prevent future malware infections.
    - Establish and enforce least privilege access controls to limit the impact of potential breaches.
    - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and patch management to address security vulnerabilities proactively.

## Step 5: Recovery

11. **Data Restoration**: Restore critical data and systems from clean backups to ensure business continuity and minimize downtime.
    - Validate the integrity of backup files and verify that they are free from malware.
12. **System Reintegration**: Gradually reintegrate cleaned systems back into the production environment while monitoring them closely for any signs of re-infection.

## Step 6: Post-Incident Analysis

13. **Lessons Learned**: Conduct a comprehensive post-mortem analysis to identify gaps in the incident response process and opportunities for improvement.
    - Document key findings, including the root causes of the malware infection, response effectiveness, and areas for enhancement.
14. **Documentation**: Document all actions taken during the incident response process, including timelines, decisions made, and lessons learned, for future reference and audit purposes.

## Step 7: Communication and Reporting

15. **Internal Communication**: Communicate incident response findings and remediation actions to relevant stakeholders within the organization, including IT teams, management, and legal departments.
16. **External Reporting**: If required by regulations or contractual obligations, report the incident to external parties, such as regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, or affected customers.
